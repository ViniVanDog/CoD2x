#### Improvements
- Added windowed and borderless window mode:
    - windowed mode: `r_fullscreen 0`
    - borderless mode: `r_fullscreen 0` and `r_mode [screen resolution]`
    - fullscreen mode: `r_fullscreen 1` (default)
- Added support for rinput (raw input for mouse movement) 
    - ![alt text](images/cod2-rinput.png)
    - `m_rinput 0` - turned off, uses Windows cursor possition to get movement (default)
    - `m_rinput 1` - raw mouse movement, dedicated thread, as external Rinput application
    - `m_rinput 2` - raw mouse movement, integrated directly into the game
    - The game is also measuring the refresh rate of the mouse:
        - ![alt text](images/cod2-rinput-hz.png)
        - `m_rinput_hz` - shows the current refresh rate of your mouse in real time
        - `m_rinput_max` - shows the maximum measured refresh rate
    - If the external Rinput application is used, the internal `m_rinput` is automatically turned off
- Added possibility to restrict FPS via mod (like zPAM) into range 125 - 250 using new cvar `com_maxfps_limit` (the cvar is cheat protected and can be set only by the server)
  - ![alt text](images/cod2-com-max-fps.png)
- Ignoring custom IWD mods on game start to avoid runtime errors (only files starting with 'iw_' or 'localized_' are loaded)
- Set sv_cheats 1 on disconnect to allow to play demo without the need to do devmap
- Improved error message `recursive error after: Can¬¥t create Dvar 'xxx': 1280 dvars already exist`:
    - ![alt text](images/cod2-error-dvars-1280.png)
- Added informative texts into console with changes that has been applied when connected to the server:
    - ![alt text](images/cod2-changes-console.png)
- Added crash reporter
  - ![alt text](images/cod2-crash-error.png)
- Added process freeze detection
  - ![alt text](images/cod2-freeze-error.png)
  - It can be disabled by setting `/com_freezeWatch 0`
- Tickrate
  - ![alt text](images/cod2-tick-wireshark.png)
  - Server FPS maximum increased from 30 to 40 (`sv_fps 40`)
  - Client max snaps increased from 30 to 40 (`snaps 40`)
  - Client max packet value increased from 100 to 125 (`cl_maxpackets 125`)
    - This allows to send exactly 125 packets at 250FPS (instead of ~83.3)
- HWID
  - An unique hardware ID is generated for each computer
  - The HWID is used to ban cheaters on the server via commands `/banClient <clientId>` and `/unbanAll` (bans are saved in file `main\ban.txt`)
  - The HWID is replacing GUID that was generated by PunkBuster, which is no longer supported
  - The HWID is an non-zero unsigned 32-bit integer, like `560978975`
  - You can see your HWID in the game by checking cvar `/cl_hwid`
  - ![alt text](images/cod2-hwid.png)
- Added possibility to change the master via cvars
  - client: `cl_masterServer`, `cl_masterPort`
  - server: `sv_master1`, `sv_master2`, `sv_master3`
    - `sv_master1` is forced to be `cod2master.activision.com`
    - `sv_master2` is forced to be `master.cod2x.me`
    - `sv_master3` is customizable
- New cvar `sv_cracked` to make the server accept players with invalid CDKEY
- New cvar `showPacketStrings` to show network communication data
- New commands `/increase` and `/decrease` to increase or decrease the value of a cvar
- Reversed function for third person, added new cvar `cg_thirdPersonMode 1` that rotates directly around player without collision with the world


# How to install (client on Windows)
1. You need original Call of Duty 2 with version [1.3](https://www.moddb.com/games/call-of-duty-2/downloads/call-of-duty-2-pc-patch-v-13) installed.
2. Download latest version of CoD2x - [CoD2x_1.4.3.4_windows.zip](https://github.com/eyza-cod2/CoD2x/releases/download/v1.4.3.4/CoD2x_1.4.3.4_windows.zip)
3. Extract these files from the archive to the Call of Duty 2 folder, replacing any existing file:
    - üìÑ mss32.dll
    - üìÑ mss32_original.dll
4. Final structure should look like this:
    - üìÅ Call of Duty 2
        - üìÅ Docs
        - üìÅ main
        - üìÅ miles
        - üìÅ pb
        - üìÑ CoD2MP_s.exe
        - üìÑ CoD2SP_s.exe
        - üìÑ gfx_d3d_mp_x86_s.dll
        - üìÑ gfx_d3d_x86_s.dll
        - üìÑ **mss32.dll**
        - üìÑ **mss32_original.dll**
        - üìÑ ... (other files)
5. The archive also contains additional files that are not required to be installed:
    - üìÑ CoD2x Installation and uninstallation manual.txt


# How to uninstall (client on Windows)
1. Delete the following files:
    - üìÑ mss32.dll
2. Rename following file:
    - üìÑ mss32_original.dll  ->  üìÑ mss32.dll


# How to install (server on Linux)
1. Download latest version of CoD2x - [CoD2x_1.4.3.4_linux.zip](https://github.com/eyza-cod2/CoD2x/releases/download/v1.4.3.4/CoD2x_1.4.3.4_linux.zip)
2. Extract this file from the archive to the Call of Duty 2 folder:
    - üìÑ libCoD2x.so
3. Final structure should look like this:
    - üìÅ Call of Duty 2
        - üìÅ main
        - üìÅ pb
        - üìÑ cod2_lnxded
        - üìÑ libCoD2x.so
4. The archive also contains additional files that are not required to be installed:
    - üìÑ CoD2x Installation and uninstallation manual.txt
    - üìÑ cod2_lnxded    (official 1.3 game version)
5. Update chmod for the libCoD2x.so file to be executable:
    - `chmod +x libCoD2x.so`
6. Run the game with LD_PRELOAD, for example:
    - `LD_PRELOAD=libCoD2x.so ./cod2_lnxded +exec server.cfg`
    - üõà Its not common that server providers support adding this, only server administrators can do that.
7. Auto-update is enabled by default. Make sure to enable UDP port 20720. If you want to disable auto-update, set `sv_update "0"` or disable UDP port 20720. On server start, the server will check for the latest version of CoD2x and download it if available. File libCoD2x.so will be replaced with the latest version. Process restart is needed to apply the update. 






# How to install for developers
1. Clone this repository.
2. Copy .iwd files from original Call of Duty 2 1.3 main folder to `./bin/windows/main` folder in this repository (iw_01..iw_15 and localized_english_iw00..localized_english_iw11)

# Repository layout
- üìÅ **bin**
    - üìÅ **linux** - *Linux server binaries*
    - üìÅ **windows** - *Windows game binaries from original CD with 1.3 patch applied*
- üìÅ **src**
    - üìÅ **linux** - *code related only for Linux server*
    - üìÅ **mss32** - *code related for Windows, mimicking mss32.dll*
    - üìÅ **shared** - *code shared for both Linux server and Windows version*
    - üìÅ **other** - *reversed / testing code*
- üìÅ **tools** - *contains external tools for coding, compiling, etc..*
- üìÅ **zip** - *zip files are generated here*

To avoid source code duplication, the code that is used for both Linux and Windows is placed in `üìÅsrc / üìÅshared` folder. Its primarily a server side code. 

The code that is related only for Windows version or Linux server is placed in particular folders `üìÅsrc / üìÅmss32` or `üìÅsrc / üìÅlinux`, both sharing the shared folder.



# How the Windows mss32.dll works
CoD2MP_s.exe has following dynamic libraries:
- WINMM.dll       
- WSOCK32.dll     
- mss32.dll       <-- *hooking this library*
- d3d9.dll        
- DSOUND.dll      
- KERNEL32.dll    
- USER32.dll      
- GDI32.dll       
- ADVAPI32.dll    
- SHELL32.dll     

These libraries are loaded at runtime when the CoD2MP_s.exe is started.

File mss32.dll is a Miles Sound System dynamic link library used for audio playback.
This file is replaced with our custom mss32.dll, which exports the same functions as the original mss32.dll.

The CoD2MP_s.exe imports 364 functions from original mss32.dll:
- _AIL_set_sample_adpcm_block_size@8
- _AIL_enumerate_3D_providers@12
- _AIL_end_sample@4
- _AIL_set_3D_position@16
- ...

Our version of mss32.dll has the same exported functions as original.
These functions act as a proxy to the original functions in the original mss32.dll.
    
    [CoD2MP_s.exe]
        ‚Üì
    [mss32.dll]            <- this file
        ‚Üì
    [mss32_original.dll]   <- original mss32.dll

When our mss32.dll is loaded, it loads mss32_original.dll and redirect all exported functions.
It also runs patching process that modifies the game memory to fix some bugs and add new features.
